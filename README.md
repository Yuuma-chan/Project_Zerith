# Project_Zerith
Project Zerith is a idea of a Discord Bot that makes Discord itself into a game via hosting a server and let the server members complete certain tasks

Zerith is a bot that should administrate a server on its own to a certain degree where the "Hard-Rules" are set.

Zerith lets members get a certain role on the Server, for example on 50 members there should be 2 admins, those can set "Soft-Rules" those can be changed.

The Community can vote for Staff etc...

The Bot provides the server members with tasks to help the server grow.

In planning are multiple of those Bots to compete against each other with different server Topics and perhaps different Languages.
